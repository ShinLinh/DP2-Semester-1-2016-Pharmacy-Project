Is our project 'Done'?

We decided to not aim for learnability, understandability or attractiveness in this sprint as the purpose of this sprint was to get core functionality up and running.


Density - KLOC - How big is it?
Aim for 5% defect density

Testing
Each application function/method should not be difficult to test for. We should aim to be able to aim to not exceed 30 minutes for any given function.

Functional Appropriateness and Completeness
The product at the end of the sprint must be able to facilitate all the functions discussed in this sprint planning period.
95-100%
Why 95%?
We are not experienced programmers. We are prone to mistake as we are still learning. Therefore a 5% margin of error has been added.

Functional Correctness
100% precision is required with this application. Due to the nature of it being a sales management software for a Pharmacy there must be no inaccuracies.

Response Time
50 records, 500 milliseconds read write time to our DB

Resource Utilization
500mb RAM usage maximum
CPU Utilization - Depends on the CPU as it is difficult to properly quantify due to the vast differences between CPU generations, 
but for example on a more recent machine such as an average process (Intel Core i7-4510U @ 2.00Ghz) we should expect this application to utilize 5% of the CPU when runnning at max. 
This may vary depending on the amount of data being read/written.

Capactity
In terms of number of records, for now the inventory will contain about a hundred records, but for sales it could handle thousands a month, at an estimate 10,000 records.

As the stakeholders/product owner may or may not have experience with programming, we also have to finish at least a console application that allows demonstration
of the functions of the software without showing internal codes.
